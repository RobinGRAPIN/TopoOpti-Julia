# TopoOpti-Julia
*optimisation topologique PIR Supaéro*

This repository contains the translations in Julia of the codes written by Ole Sigmund, initially in Matlab. The code top88_AD uses in addition the method of automatic differentiation to approach almost exactly the derivative of the objective function. 

These algorithms have been encoded for my project of second year at ISAE-Supaéro, under the supervivion of Joseph Morlier.
